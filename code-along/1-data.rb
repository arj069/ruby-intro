# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers
# puts 5

# Perform simple math with numbers
# puts 5*3
# puts 5.0/3.0 to get it to divide float numbers and not round off

# Strings
# puts "Hello"

# Combine strings together
# puts "Hello" + " world"
# puts "tacos" * 3 to print "tacos" out thrice
# puts "tacos" + 3 will give an error

# Variables
# food = "tacos"
# puts food

# x = 5
# y = 3
# puts x*y; can redeclare variables (i.e., can declare x=10 after x=5 and the former will stick)

# Combine strings and variables
# puts "#{x} tacos"; outputs "5 tacos"


# String manipulation
# puts "Hello".length
# puts "How are you?".upcase
# puts "computers are hard".reverse
